<p align="center"><i>The app that helps you dress up your baby in any weather, anywhwere in the world.</i></p>

MyBabyWeather is an app designed to **help new parents dress up babies and toddlers** according to the current or future weather forecast anywhere in the world. No need to worry: with MyBabyWeather you can **plan a play date in the park today or a trip to the mountains this weekend** and dress your little one accordingly.

MyBabyWeather has been **programmed with Kotlin** as an exercise for my Associate Android Developer and Google UX Design certifications. **The UI and icons have been designed from scratch** for this project.

**MyBabyWeather will be in Google play very soon!** üöÄ
