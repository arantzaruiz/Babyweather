MyBabyWeather is an app designed to help new parents dress up babies and toddlers according to the current or future weather forecast in any location in the world. No need to worry: with MyBabyWeather you can plan a play date in the park or a trip to the mountains and dress your little one accordingly.

MyBabyWeather has been programmed with Kotlin as an exercise for my Associate Android Developer and Google UX Design certifications.

MyBabyWeather will be in Google play very soon!
