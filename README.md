MyBabyWeather is an app designed to help new parents dress up their babies and toddlers according to the current or future weather forecast in their current location or any other location in the world. No need to worry: with MyBabyWeather you can plan a play date in the park or a trip to the mountains and plan accordingly your little one's outfit.

MyBabyWeather has been programmed with Kotlin as an exercise for my Associate Android Developer and Google UX Design certifications.
